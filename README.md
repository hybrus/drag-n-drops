### Design
The "drag-n-drops" application is a Next.js application that allows the user to drag and drop various elements, including images, graphs, and text boxes, into a layout. The user interface is designed using HTML and CSS, and the drag-and-drop functionality is implemented using JavaScript and the HTML5 Drag and Drop API.

The main components of the user interface include:

* A sidebar that contains a list of draggable elements, including images, graphs, and text boxes.
* A layout area where the user can drop the draggable elements to create a layout.
* A trash bin that appears when the user drags an element from the layout to remove it.
* A component sorting function that allows the user to rearrange the order of the elements within the layout.

###Functionality
The "drag-n-drops" application allows the user to perform the following tasks:

* Drag elements: The user can drag elements from the sidebar, including images, graphs, and text boxes, and drop them into the layout area. When the user drops an element into the layout area, the application displays a form that allows the user to enter required data for the element. Once the user submits the form, the application creates a new component for the element type and renders it in the layout area.
* Drop elements: When the user drops an element into the layout area, the application creates a new component for the element and renders it in the layout area.
* Remove elements: The user can remove elements from the layout area by dragging them to the trash bin. The trash bin will appear when the user is dragging an element from the layout area.
  Sort elements: The user can rearrange the order of the elements within the layout area by clicking on an element and dragging it to a new location within the layout area.

###Usage
To use the "drag-n-drops" application, the user must have a web browser that supports HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can then run the application by downloading the repository and running the `npm install` command to install the required dependencies. Once the dependencies have been installed, the user can run the application using the `npm run dev` command.

Once the application is running, the user can drag elements from the sidebar and drop them into the layout area. If the user drops a text box, the application will display a form that allows the user to enter text for the text box. Once the user has added all the desired elements to the layout, the user can remove elements by dragging them to the trash bin and can sort the order of the elements by clicking and dragging them to a new location within the layout area.

###Limitations
The "drag-n-drops" application is a simple demo that is designed to illustrate how to implement drag-and-drop functionality and component sorting in a Next.js application. As such, it has several limitations, including:

Limited functionality: The application only allows the user to drag and drop elements into a layout area, remove them by dragging to the trash bin, and sort their order within the layout area. It does not provide more advanced features, such as resizing elements or rotating elements.
Compatibility: The application may not work on all web browsers or on mobile devices. It is designed to work on modern web browsers that support HTML5 and JavaScript, but may not work on older browsers or devices with limited processing power.
No user accounts: The application does not support user accounts or authentication, so anyone with access to the application can modify the layout.
